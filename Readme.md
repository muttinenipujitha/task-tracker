# Task Tracker

A lightweight, responsive Task Tracker web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to manage their daily to-do lists efficiently with a clean and intuitive interface.

## Features

*   **Add Tasks:** Easily input new tasks via a user-friendly input field and button.
*   **Task List:** Displays a clean list of all added tasks.
*   **Status Toggle:** Click on any task to instantly toggle its status between 'Pending' and 'Completed'.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Tasks are visually distinct (strikethrough text, color changes) when completed.
*   **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved to the browser's **LocalStorage**, meaning your list remains even if you refresh or close the page.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For semantic and accessible structure.
*   **CSS3:** For modern styling, Flexbox layout, and responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For DOM manipulation, event handling, and LocalStorage management.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

No build tools or servers are required.

## Future Improvements

*   Add a delete button to remove tasks permanently.
*   Include a "Clear All" button to reset the list.
*   Add an "Edit" feature to modify existing tasks.
*   Implement task categorization (e.g., Work, Personal).
